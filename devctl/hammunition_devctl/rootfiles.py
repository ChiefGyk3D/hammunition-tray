"""Writing a root-owned file so nobody ever reads half of it.  D-056, D-058.

Two rules, both learned on the kept-off rules file (#119):

- **Write a unique temp file beside the target, fsync it, then ``os.replace``.**
  A reader sees the old file or the new one, never a splice. A fixed temp name
  lets two runs interleave into one file; ``mkstemp`` cannot collide. The temp
  name is hidden and ends ``.tmp``, so neither udev (``*.rules``) nor ntpd
  (``*.conf``) ever reads it, and it is unlinked on any failure.
- **Hold an flock on the directory across a read-modify-write**, so a second
  run reads the first run's result instead of overwriting it. The directory
  itself is locked, so no lock file is left behind.

**File modes.** Both callers write ``0644``, root-owned, and that is a
decision, not a default: the kept-off udev rules are read by udev and the
linger record by the unprivileged ``state`` and ``linger`` verbs that report
it to the operator, so ``0600`` would blind them. Neither holds a secret (a
device's name and USB identifier, an on/off flag). What is never allowed is a
mode another account can *write*: ``atomic_write`` refuses any mode with a
group or other write bit, so no caller can widen these files into
something an unprivileged account could edit and have root act on.

Neither decides *which* path may be written. Every caller admits its own
paths with an exact-path guard before it gets here.
