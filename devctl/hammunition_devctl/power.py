"""Parking and waking a catalogued device.  D-056.

Turning a ``power_control`` block into the exact sysfs writes it means, and
performing them with the effect verified afterwards rather than the exit
status trusted (D-031).

**What persists is intent, not state.** A parked device stays parked through
one udev rule per device in `KEPT_RULES`, applied by udev as the device
appears. Whether a device *is* parked is still read from sysfs by
:func:`parkable`; the file only says what the operator asked for, and `state`
reports both.

**Nothing here knows about polkit, argparse or the tray.** It is given matched
devices and returns writes. The privileged boundary is
:mod:`hammunition_devctl.devctl`; the surfaces are the engine's CLI, its menu
and the tray. All of them go through the same planner so all of them
disclose the same thing.
