"""Opt-in unattended operation: linger for the station operator.  D-073 §5a.

``station set --unattended`` keeps the operator's user services running with
nobody logged in — a remote HF station, a Pi at a served agency. It routes
``loginctl enable-linger`` through the D-056 helper (``hammunition-devctl
linger on``), which acts only on the calling account and records what it did in
``/etc/hammunition/linger.yaml`` so the reversal knows whether linger was ours
to turn off.

Pure here; the helper reads the current state and runs the command. The one
root write is the record, through the D-058 atomic writer.
